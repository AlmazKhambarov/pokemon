# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Welcome to My Pokemon App

Pokémon[a] is a Japanese media franchise consisting of video games, animated series and films, a trading 
card game, and other related media. The franchise takes place in a shared universe in which humans co-exist 
with creatures known as Pokémon, a large variety of species endowed with special powers. The franchise's 
target audience is children aged 5 to 12,[1] but it is known to attract people of all ages.[2][3][4][5]

The franchise originated as a pair of role-playing games developed by Game Freak, following an original 
concept by its founder, Satoshi Tajiri. Released on the Game Boy on February 27, 1996, the games became
 sleeper hits and were followed by manga series, a trading card game, and anime series and films. From 1998 
 to 2000, Pokémon was exported to the rest of the world, creating an unprecedented global phenomenon dubbed 
 "Pokémania". By 2002, the craze had ended, after which Pokémon became a fixture in popular culture, with new
  products being released to this day. In the summer of 2016, the franchise spawned a second craze with the
   release of Pokémon Go, an augmented reality game developed by Niantic. Pokémon has since been estimated to 
   be the world's highest-grossing media franchise and one of the best-selling video game franchises.
